This is a fork of [libGDX's Box2DLights](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights), needed to ensure compatibility with latest libGDX and OpenGL version + some features:

- Reworked for a modern OpenGL architecture with batching and performance improvements
- Normal maps
- Pseudo3D lights
- Custom light falloff (Constant-Linear-Quadratic)
- Custom light intensity
- MSAA Samples
